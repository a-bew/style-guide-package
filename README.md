# Style Guide Package

A comprehensive UI component library and design system built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. This package aims to provide a consistent and reusable set of UI components and design tokens to streamline development and maintain brand consistency across applications.

## Features

*   **Reusable UI Components:** A rich collection of pre-built and customizable React components (buttons, dropdowns, inputs, etc.).
*   **Design System:** Defined styles, typography, color palettes, and spacing to ensure visual consistency.
*   **Theming Support:** Easily switch between different themes or customize existing ones.
*   **Responsive Design:** Components are designed to be responsive and work across various screen sizes.
*   **Developer Friendly:** Built with TypeScript for type safety and a clear API for easy integration.
